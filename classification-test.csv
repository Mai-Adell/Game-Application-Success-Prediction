The oldest known form of the game is shown in a painting from the tomb of Hesy (circa 2686-2613 BCE). Many pictures of the game and artifacts have been discovered and are displayed in Museums around the world. The commonness of these finds indicates that the game was very popular in its time.\n\nThe main adversaries in Senet are the Spools and the Pyramids. These pawns follow a path from their start positions to the House of Horus in an inverted 'S'. The player moving all of his pawns off the board first wins. Fields on the Senet board are called houses. Some of these have special significance and are adorned with icons like the Ankh symbol. Instead of dice flattened sticks are used. Each stick has a bright side and a dark side. Every bright side is a point. If only dark sides are showing the player is awarded 5 points. When a 1, 4, or 5 is thrown the player gets another turn.\n\nWhen moving into a field occupied by an opponent, the pieces switch places. If, however, the opponent's pawn is part of a row of two or more, it cannot be beaten. It is possible to 'jump' over an opponent if it isn't part of a row of 3 pieces or more. 3 pieces are considered a block and are an important strategic tool.\n\nThrough symbology Senet hints at the afterlife as seen from an Egyptian point of view. If one's piece is beaten on one of the last three fields or the jump over the House of Water is not successful one moves back to the house of Rebirth. In such the game alludes to reincarnation and the journey of the dead.\n\nSenet Deluxe is a truly unique strategy game. It features great animation, a soundtrack, an intelligent adversary, enforceable backwards moves, highlighting for acceptable moves, game statistics and online help. Be prepared to spend many hours with the most popular game of the antiquity.\n\nFor more screenshots and several videos of the application in action, please visit the website indicated below.""",RoGame Software,4+,"DA, NL, EN, FR, DE, EL, IT, JA, KO, NO, PT, RU, ZH, ES, SV",34689024,Games,"Games, Strategy, Board, Education",18/07/2008,22/07/2018,Intermediate

This is a summary of the rules of Mancala: Marbles & Seeds: \n\nEach player, on his or her turn, chooses one of the 6 holes on his or her side and deals the stones throughout the board in an anticlockwise direction, leaving one stone in each hole and in the player's Mancala.

If the last stone dealt falls in an empty hole on the player's side of the board, this player captures all the stones in the opponent's parallel hole. \n\nThe game ends when one of the players does not have any more stones in the holes on his or her side of the board. When this happens, the stones that remain shall go to the other player's Mancala.

The matriarch is dying, and murder is in the air - whoever survives this night will walk away with a fortune!\n\nIn this nasty, conniving, and thoroughly awful multiplayer strategy game, players take on the role of one of the four nobles trying to kill off the others.  Each noble is surrounded by a retinue of leeches, hangers-ons, and sycophants who can be bent to your will through the use of blackmail, flattery, or intimidation.\n\nYour goal is to gain influence over these subordinates, give one of them a weapon, and send them over amidst your opponents.  If you have enough influence over the subordinates, and they have a weapon, they\'ll kill that noble for you, and you\'re one corpse closer to winning the game!\n\nThe game is played in a turn-based fashion, using an innovative ""pass the phone"" style.  Each player takes a turn on the device, and then hands it to the next player to take their turn.  The device is handed around between players until one of them wins.  Audio cues triggered during play give other players clues as to what the current player might be doing, which adds to the intrigue.\n\nThis game may be played by 2 to 4 players, however, because it\'s all played on the same device, you only need one copy of the game to play with your friends.

Choose your path wisely and discover our multiple endings.\n\nSick and tired of his father\u2019s slurs and insults, Louis decides to leaves behind a life of wealth and comfort, he wants to know the real world, what it is out there but before he can do that he enters the Dark Forest where he meets a young woman, but things are not what it seems, choose Louis Versetti\u2019s path wisely.\n\nOne of the finest vehicles of the large Versetti fleet approaches the stately gates of the family residence, a huge luxurious mansion constructed with the finest materials to be found in the whole of Scotland. The car drives through lovely gardens for over seventy meters, but when it stops at the mansion\u2019s front entrance, nobody steps out of the vehicle, as the butler patiently waits at the ready to welcome the vehicle\u2019s occupants. \n\nThe sound of someone shouting can be heard when the car door opens after a few minutes.\n\nThat\u2019s the last time I\u2019m putting up with your slurs and your insults, yelled Louis Versetti, son of the multimillionaire Paolo Versetti.\n\nVery slowly and calmly, Louis\u2019 father steps out of the car after his son; he doesn\u2019t follow him, he just looks at him with a hard and dismissive stare. \n\nYou think I don\u2019t deserve any of this.  Do you think I\u2019m not worthy?  Okay, so that\u2019s the way it will be then; I will not accept a penny of your fortune; I will not accept anything that is yours.  I\'m leaving this house right now!  Louis exclaimed energetically in a determined tone of voice, while his father just looked on with a smirk on his face, which, if anything, just provoked him all the more, making him even angrier. \n\nLouis turns around slowly, and without hesitation begins to walk through the large garden, back towards the mansion\u2019s gate. No one makes a single sound; the only thing to be heard is the sound the shoes make as they walk down the paved driveway; those fine shoes which were manufactured in Italy, his father\u2019s native land. His father came to this country when he was very young and single-handedly became a millionaire in just ten years by creating multiple companies.\n\nLouis is about to reach the gate, and all he\u2019s taking with him to face the world on his own is just a leather jacket and some money in his wallet.\n\nI\u2019ll show him what I can accomplish on my own, thinks the 23-year-old, who feels he is ready to forge his own path in life. \n\n Before leaving the grounds, he turns a little to the right to look at the small storage shed where old things are kept, and where he knows his old motorcycle is stored. It\u2019s been years since he last used it, so it must be very dusty and maybe even a little rusty, but Louis is almost certain that it still works. \n\nAlthough Louis had been determined to leave on foot, he thinks it will be much better on that bike. He is about to go and pick up the motorcycle when he remembers it was a gift given to him by his father when he was 15 and stops in his tracks to think for a moment:\n\nChoose his path wisely, what would you do?\n\n This Interactive Book App is published by Living a Book. This isn\'t a gamebook or chat story, it\'s a Pathbook.\n\nInteractive book with multiple endings.

ScytheKick is your sidekick for Scythe, the award winning board game from Stonemaier games (http://stonemaiergames.com/games/scythe/).\n\nScytheKick has five main tabs:\n\nFACTIONS\n\nUse this tab to randomize picking factions and player mats from the game, and select which players are Automa and which are human. Offers a repick option if the player doesn't want the random combination, or swipe up and down on the images to manually select. Swipe left and right to review what the other players got. Up to two players are supported. Additional players can be unlocked with the Premium upgrade, and Invaders from Afar factions are unlocked with the Invaders from Afar upgrade, both in the ScytheKick Store. This tab also sets up campaign episodes when the Rise of Fenris Expansion is unlocked.\n\nTILES & MODS\n\nUse this tab to randomly pick the tiles at the start of a match, like the Structure Bonus Tile. Resolution and Airship Tiles can be unlocked with the Wind Gambit Expansion, and Mods from the Rise of Fenris Expansion can be unlocked, both from the ScytheKick Store.\n\nAUTOMA\n\nFor solo mode or additional AI opponents, this tab creates a page for each Automa opponent (with all four difficulty levels available). Use the buttons to draw turn cards, combat cards or discard and advance the star tracker, or optionally double tap to draw and dismiss cards. Automatically reshuffles and flips from Scheme I to Scheme II. One Automa opponent is available in the Preview mode of the app. Additional decks can be unlocked with the Premium upgrade in the ScytheKick Store. Use the Automa Helper (gameboard icon) to solve Automa movement via an upgrade from the ScytheKick Store. Swipe up or tap the map button to bring it up. On compatible devices, view the Automa movement in augmented reality using the AR Board Upgrade.\n\nSCORING\n\nOn this tab, you can simplify end game scoring when counting stars, territories and resources, coins and structure bonuses. Tap the numbers to update the values, and tap the icons to move to the next category. Swipe left and right to move between factions if a match has been set up in the Faction Picker. Automatically divides the resources by two, so just enter the number you have.\n\nSETTINGS\n\nIncludes settings for:\n* Manage In-App Purchases in the ScytheKick Store\n* Online user guide.\n* Adjustable volume\n* Disable screen locking when Automa is in use\n* Choosing whether Automa are friendly to other Automa players for the Automa Helper solver. Choose if Active Airship Variant is used. Select the board size for the AR Board.\n* Smooth Popularity Track mode awards coins not just based on the three tiers on the Popularity Track, but interpolates linearly between each level and also counts odd numbers of resources. Scores at popularity 3, 9 and 15 score as normal, but scores higher and lower increase and decrease. For example, scores between popularity of 6 and 7 are closer with the setting mode on.\n\nScytheKick is an unofficial companion to the board game Scythe, produced with permission of the game designer.
